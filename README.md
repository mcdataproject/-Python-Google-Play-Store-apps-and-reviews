# [Python] Google Play Store apps and reviews

## Introduction
In this project, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. Analyzing such data could find the answers to the following questions like:
- Which two app categories have the highest share in the app market?
- Does the size of an app affect its rating? Do users prefer light-weighted apps? 
- Do users always prefer free apps over paid apps?
- Are paid apps installed as much as free apps? 

## Data Collection
There are two datasets:
1. **apps.csv**: contains all the details of the apps on Google Play.
2. **user_reviews.csv**: contains 100 reviews for each app. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.

## Technology
* **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Seaborn and Matplotlib) using **Jupyter Notebook**
